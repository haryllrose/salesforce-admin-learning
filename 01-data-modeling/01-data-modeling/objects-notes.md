# Standard vs Custom Objects

## Standard Objects
- Account
- Contact
- Opportunity
- Lead

Standard objects are provided by Salesforce and cover common CRM needs.

## Custom Objects
- Created to store business-specific data
- API name ends with __c

Custom objects are used when standard objects do not fully meet business requirements.

## Notes
- Always check if a standard object can be used before creating a custom object
- Too many custom objects can make an org harder to maintain
